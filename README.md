Predict movie revenue

Predict Movie Licensing
Watch-lt is a media services company whose primary business is its
subscription-based streaming service offering access to a library of films
and television programs.
Watch-lt has a state-of-the-art content team which actively scouts and
recommends content that will attract viewers. The more people watch a
particular title, the more revenue is generated for Watch-lt from
advertisements and brand integrations. Management wants to know
which titles will generate more revenue so that they can license them.
I-Jsing machine learning, help them predict what titles would be suitable
for licensing. Explain how different features affect the decision.

Problem
Perform an analysis of the given data to determine how different
features are related to revenue. Build a machine learning model
that can predict the revenue_category.
For each record in the test set ('test' sheet), predict the value of the
revenue_category variable (Low or High). Submit a CSV file with a
header row plus each of the test entries, each on its own line. The
file (submissions.csv) should have exactly 2 columns:
• title
• revenue_category(contains Low or High)
Deliverables
• Well commented Jupyter notebook
• "submissions.csv"
Explore the data, make visualizations, and generate new features if
required. Make appropriate plots, annotate the notebook with
markdowns and explain necessary inferences. A person should be
able to read the notebook and understand the steps you take as
well as the reasoning behind them.
Evaluation Metric
The metric used for evaluating the performance of Accuracy.
Accuracy = number of correct predictions/total number of
predictions
